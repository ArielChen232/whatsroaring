                WhatsRoaring was designed by five Princeton students who wanted to streamline
                the process of finding and saving events for Princeton students.
                Once you create a free account, you can browse events happening around Princeton
                campus and Princeton town and filter events based on your interests, such as
                Arts or Athletics. You can also favorite events and export them to your
                Google Calendar.

                If you're a member of an approved Princeton organization, you may register
                for administrative access. As an event administrator, you can add your
                organization's events to our community calendar.

                Shoutout to Leora Huebner '19 for coming up with our project name.
